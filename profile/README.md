## Welcome to Golden Sphere!

### General Rules
- Default Branch is [main] Branch.
- Make pull request after you pushed to the main branch.
- Do not 'Merge the PR you made' by yourself. *Remember that the only project manager has the Merge authority.*
- Create new branch. We higly recommend to use these format (yourName/#fileThatYouWillModify or yourName/#featureThatYouWillMake) while creating new branch so that others can easily know what the branch is about.
- The more you write comments in your codes, the easier others can read the codes. *Remember that you are working as a team now.*
- Use `$ git pull` before working so that you get the latest version of our repository.
- All developers should manage the branches which they made.
